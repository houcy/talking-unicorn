# Talking Unicorn ü¶Ñ
## History
Some time ago I had an interesting conversation about unicorns with a girl. ü¶Ñ
The day after this conversation, as a joke, I went to her with a 3D printed unicorn that greets and says her name when tilted.
It was really weird but he liked it and we laughed a lot about it. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
While I really don't think that someone else will be so crazy to seriously reproduce it, I would like to share with you the project, since it could be used as base for other audio based Arduino projects.

## Final Result
