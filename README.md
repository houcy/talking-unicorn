# Talking Unicorn ü¶Ñ
> An Arduino based greeting unicorn that says something to your girl when tilted.


### History
Some time ago I had an interesting conversation about unicorns with a girl. ü¶Ñ
The day after this conversation, as a joke, I went to her with a 3D printed unicorn that greets and says her name when tilted.
It was really weird but she liked it and we laughed a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
